While I've been working on project 'Use Datum SDK to make "Something Innovative" without limits'
 i became comfortable about Datum SDK. If there is more time i hope i will become comfortable with eth-lightwallet. i managed to do:
 1. i create new identity and wrote in file 
 2. become comfortable with node.js module dateformat (MIT Licence)
 3. insert system date in certain format in Datum SDK data storage
 If i have more time i could do some cryptography, because as i know timestamp(system time) is used in cryptography algorithm frequently.
